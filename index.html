It is got from the IS 445 course website, and I did some minor modification on data structures to fit 
the visualization of this homework. In the embedded vega-lite plot, I used line mark to show the selected state’s export values distribution over years. Because line 
graphs are good to track changes over short or long periods of time. Users can easily get the differences between states from the plot.</p><p>Two of idyll’s built-in components were used in the webpage. The first one is Select (Input category), users are able to choose a state name with it. The second one is 
Conditional (Logic category), by using this, the line graph can be updated according to the selected state name.</p><p>Basically, it is all about my Homework #10. Thanks for reading.</p></div></div></div></div>
